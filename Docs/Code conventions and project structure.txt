Here are described code conventions and project structure. They can differ slightly from class to class, but common structure, described here, is valid.

1. Project structure details:

Canvas - scripts to work with canvas element.
|
|->	Geometry - geometry objects and math fundametals.
	|->	Point.js - 2D point implementation.
|
|->	Rendering - rendering scripts.
	|-> Color.js - class to work with color in different formats.

2. Class template:

/*
 * CLASSNAME by AUTHOR, dd Mmm yyyy
 *
 * CLASS DESCRIPTION
 */


//ANONYMOUS FUNCTION WRAPPER
( function() {
//PRIVATE
	//private code and data(local for anonymous function) with simple comments
	
	
//CONSTRUCTOR
	//class constructor with jsDoc
	
	
//STATIC
	//static properties and methods with jsDoc
	
	
//PROTOTYPE
	//prototype methods with jsDoc
}() );

3. Code conventions:

Classes:    var ClassName = function() { ... }
Variables:  var myVar = 0, myVar2 = 2, ... , myVarN = N;
Arrays 		var myArr = [], myArr1 = [1, 2, 3, ... , n];
Objects:    var myObj = { prop1: val1, prop2: val2, .... , propn: valn };
